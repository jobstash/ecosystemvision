  summary:
    'Sound was founded with the hypothesis that music fans crave a deeper experience and are willing to support their favorite artists. The fixed price of music is suffocating artists, with streaming services refusing to unlock the full value of music and failing to allow music fans to directly support artists. As a result, only 0.1% of musicians make a living wage from their art. On Sound, artists can release their music and sell digital collectibles to their fans. Listeners can discover and collect new music to prove they were an early supporter and engage with their favorite artists. For the first time, curators can create playlists and share their favorite songs and earn alongside the artists.',
